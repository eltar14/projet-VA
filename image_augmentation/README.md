## Improvements

- [ ] `A.Normalize` outputs a black image when used, don't know why, but not using this option doesn't impact negatively the results.
- [ ] Can't install `pybboxes` to use `pybboxes.convert_bbox` to convert to bounding boxes from YOLO format to VOC format to print it for debug purposes. Dependencies issues.
